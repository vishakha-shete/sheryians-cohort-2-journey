***//introduction to javascript
- javascript is scripting language
- compuers understand the binary langauge
  which is in 0/1 zeroes and ones format
- 01010101010101 format -compuers understand the 01 language
  but we dont understand the cmps lang we understand english
- we right a code in english and the computer translate them into binary
--->i am vishakha-->translator-/interpriter/compiler--->010101/binary lang
- javascript a langauge which we right and then cmps convert them into 0101101
- cmps is very powerfull if we use them then our work is getting too easy we have to just right the code and cmps do all the efforts
- we dont understand the cmps lang and cmps also dont understand our
  langauge then make one traanslater in which the translator convert and double and flip also



* - js devloped by brendan eich
  - he works in netscape company
  - he ceate the langauge betweeen 15 to 16 days
  - the langauge create in less time duration thats why lot of
    ishues and errors ,bugs accurs 
  - while fixing this all ishues and bugs js launches a lot of versions
  - after lot of errors and bug fixing the biggest version came out which name is --es6 
  - after es6 the lot of version come but the es6 is the biggest change ever in javascript 
    history beacuase js has changed completely 
  - which means all the problems and bugs and errors in js has been fixed
  - js has created only for browser
  - js work on browser
  - we connect js file with index.html file
  - when the html file runss then only your js file also run

   creation we use javascript


*** //what can it do for you ?
-It creates engagement, interactions, animations, validation 
there is a lot of things which u can do uing the javascript 


***//we have to use script tag to attach js in index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>2nd class of js</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>hello</h1>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
    *-like this we can attached the js file
</body>
</html>


***//var , let ,const ..!
 - console.log("heyyyy");
   it is use for printinting the word

  - console.error("heyyyy");
    it used for showing a error

   - console.warn("heyyyy");
     it used for warning



***//console... prompt alert..!

  -prompt()
     prompt is something in which we have to enter
     some key before go through the webpages

  -prompt("name...?")   
  -when we want some spacific things to enter...!

  -Alert("name...?")
  it shows the alert msg which we want and its work like a
  prompt



***//what is string?

the letter, the word,combination,sentense we right in double codes
callled string

EX:- "" =double codes



***//slice, template strings split ,replace,includes how thi all
  works we learnt thiss..?
* slice
  "how are u vishakha".slice(4.12)
  it takes alphabet outer from index 4 and to 12

* template strings
  `` --> this is the backtick
         templete string
         (templete literal)

* split
  "vishakha take a step and work hard".split("a")         
    -after this the "a" will not show

 "vishakha take a step and work hard".split("a").joind() 
  -if we used joined in it then it joined the string        



* replace
   replace
  -"vishakha you need do to impoossible efforts".replace ('a',"vishu")
     it rplace only one alphabet

   replaceAll
  -"visa loa vocha aloka".replaceAll('a',"visha")
    we replaceAll similiar the alphabet with letter



* includes

 -"visa loa vocha aloka".includes("a")
   it shows value true or false if letter
   present then it show true otherwise false
