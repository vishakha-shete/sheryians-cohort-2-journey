we are using vercel and render almost for free but whenever u are going to company ur not using free everytime their we have to pay for each one thing
we are now learning so it available for learning part free but in production we have to pay for this when we are building actual system 

vercel pricing 
- for hobby it is free - 50 user 
- in free resources they are giving us limited resources 
- for pro user it added extra feature 


render pricing
- for hobby it is free -0.1cpu free- 10 user 
- in free resources they are giving us limited resources 
- for pro user it added extra feature  0.5cpu - 55 users 2gb ram 1 cpu - $7 per month
