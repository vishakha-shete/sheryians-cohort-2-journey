🚀 Backend Development – Day 1

Origin: 20

{
What I’m learning today 👇
1️⃣ How to run JavaScript outside the browser
- We can run JavaScript using Node.js

Command:
- node filename.js
- This allows JavaScript to work on the server side, not just in the browser.

}


{
2️⃣ What are Packages?
- A package is code that we did not write ourselves
- It is already written by other developers and shared publicly
- Other developers can install and use this code in their projects
- This reusable code is called a package

We will learn:
How to install packages
- npm website has lots of packages 
- the packages are available in npm.js website
How to use packages in our project

}

{
3️⃣ What is a Server?
- A server is a program that:
- Receives requests from users (clients)
- Processes those requests
- Sends responses back to users
}

{
4️⃣ Create a Server using Express
Use Express.js (a Node.js framework)
It helps us create servers faster and easier
}


{
5️⃣ Program the Server to Respond to Users
Handle different routes (URLs)
Send responses like:

Text
JSON data
Messages
}


{
6️⃣ Deploy the Server
Make the server live on the internet
So anyone can access it using a URL
}

✨ Today marks the start of my Backend Development journey
From browser → server → real-world applications 💪
