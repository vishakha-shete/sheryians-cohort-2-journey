//statements expression

in old javascript we right variable like
---ex. var b = 12;


and in new javascript we right code like
----ex. let b = 13;

probably we have ability to use both but mostly
let is usable so we use let alwayss this is the new part 
of js and lot of things has been fixed using js



{
    var a =12;
}

if we create variable in curly brackets then the variable 
acces over all it can be accesable outer to the brackets this
is the problem in js so the problem fixes and we use let which is
only accesable in curly brackets


{
    let a = 12;
}

//we use more let not a var
//error is not enemy
//but the real enemy is one code which has no error and the code right wrong then
the biggest problem
//let fixes some good things which var dosent

let a = 1;
let b = 2;

const =3; we use const when value dont change the value is constant if we try to change the value of var then its not possible


console .log (a);
console .info (a); 

both are similiar but some browesrs shows console.info in different way
it shows a i sign front of them


console.table({name:"vishu"});



prompts....

prompt sends a alert message
let nm = prompt ("name?");


//alert
alert();

strimgs 
"if we right something in double codes is called string"
//""

how to deside string or not string
if we right a special caracter in double codes is called sometring

"vishakha shete".slice(2,4)

//``template strings;
`vishakha ${3+5}`
