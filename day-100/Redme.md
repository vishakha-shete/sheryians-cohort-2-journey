🚀 Day 101 – Career Guidance Session
LinkedIn, Resume Building & How to Get a Job in IT

Today’s session focused on career strategy, not just coding.
We learned how to remove the “fresher” tag and position ourselves strongly for IT roles.

🎯 How to Get a Job in an IT Company

* There are mainly three ways:

1️⃣ Through College Campus Placement

Many students apply.
- Companies shortlist based on HR criteria.
- Sometimes selection happens by preparation, sometimes by luck.
- Companies usually pick a small percentage from the total students.

👉 Campus helps, but it should not be the only strategy.

2️⃣ Through Referrals (Most Powerful Way)
- Approach employees working in your target company.
- Ask them to review your profile.
- If they find you capable, they may refer you.

# How employees evaluate you:
- Your LinkedIn profile
- Skills section
- Projects
- Certifications
- Activity (posting consistently every 2–4 days)
- Engagement (likes, comments, professional presence)
- If they like your profile:
- They refer you
- Company may take 2–3 interview rounds
- If you clear → you get selected

📩 How to Approach for Referral
- You should message professionally like:
- Introduce yourself briefly
- Mention your skills (Full Stack Web Development, etc.)
- Explain how your skills align with their company
- Ask them to review your profile

Request feedback
- Politely ask for referral if suitable
Also:
- Message recruiters
- Send cold emails
- Connect with experienced employees

3️⃣ Direct Application
- Apply through company website
- Apply through job platforms
- Apply through company LinkedIn page
- For direct hiring, companies look for:
- Technical skills
