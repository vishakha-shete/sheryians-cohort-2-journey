🚀 Guidance Session Reflection – Backend Journey
🧠 Session Overview

# Today’s guidance session with Ankur Sir was deeply inspiring and eye-opening. Listening to his college struggle story made me pause and reflect on my own journey.

# Compared to the challenges he faced, I realized that my struggles are much smaller. I have access to resources, education, food, and opportunities. That realization gave me clarity — I have no excuse not to work hard.
